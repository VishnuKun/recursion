## Introduction

Recursion is a powerful technique in the programming, in which a function calls itself
. Recursion can provide elegant solutions to complex problems which can't be dealt with loops easily.

## Examples

- Fibonacci : Recursive implementation of Fibonacci sequence.
- Merge Sort : Recursive implementation of Merge Sort algorithm.

## Installation

To run the examples in this project, you need to have a compatible programming environment set up. Here are the installation steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   `git clone git@github.com:VishnuKun/recursion.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd recursion`

3. Install any required dependencies, if applicable.

4. You are now ready to explore and run the recursion examples.

## Usage

1. To use Fibonacci type in the terminal:
   `ruby lib/assignment_one.rb`

If you want to get the sequence upto your desired number, just navigate to assignment one file:
`cd lib/assignment_one.rb`

And change the num variable to your desired number.

2. To use Merge Sort type in the terminal:
   `ruby lib/assignment_two.rb`
